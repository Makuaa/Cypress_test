Web Application Testing with Cypress

Hey there!

Welcome to my sample web application testing project using Cypress, a powerful end-to-end testing framework. I'm excited to showcase my knowledge and expertise in testing as I thoroughly validate crucial functionalities of the web application, ensuring it delivers a seamless user experience.

## Installation

To get started, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Follow these simple steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd web-app-testing-cypress
```

2. Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Tests

To witness the magic of Cypress in action, run the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

Watch as the test suite meticulously verifies the web application's critical features.

## Test Scenarios

I've crafted some essential test scenarios to showcase the robustness of the web application:

1. **Login with Valid Credentials:**
   Watch as the application gracefully accepts valid credentials, providing a smooth login experience.

2. **Password Recovery:**
   Witness how users can effortlessly recover their passwords through the password recovery process.

3. **Verify that New User Account Cannot Be Created Without First Name:**
   Observe how the application ensures users provide their first names when creating an account.

4. **Verify that New User Account Cannot Be Created Without Last Name:**
   See how the application enforces the requirement of a last name during account creation.

5. **Verify that New User Account Cannot Be Created Without Email Address:**
   Check how the application smartly demands users to provide an email address when creating an account.

6. **Verify that User Can Create a New Account:**
   Experience the delight as users successfully create new accounts with ease.
